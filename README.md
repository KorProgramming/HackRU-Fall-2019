# HackRU-Fall-2019
This project used Python to manipulate 10,000+ toothpaste data from Excel which included both quantitative and qualitative data 
on the pastes, such as brand and ingredints, so that the data can be easily analyzed with R to build a regression model that can 
be used to predict other toothpasteâ€™s prices.
